Web Development
Web development refers to the process of creating websites and web applications that run on the internet. It involves two main components:

Frontend Development: Focuses on the visible parts of a website (UI/UX), ensuring a great user experience. It uses technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with frameworks like React, Vue, or Angular.

Backend Development: Handles server-side logic, databases, and application functionality. It relies on languages like Node.js, Python, PHP, Java, or Ruby, and databases like MySQL, MongoDB, or PostgreSQL.

Key aspects of web development include:

Responsive Design: Making websites adaptable to all devices (desktops, tablets, smartphones).
Web Hosting: Deploying websites to servers so users can access them globally.
Version Control: Using tools like Git and platforms like GitHub to manage code effectively.
Web development combines creativity and logic, making it ideal for those who enjoy problem-solving and creating interactive digital experiences.
